## LUDO RULES:

# 2-4 players
# 4 pieces each player
# 4 yard (start) squares, one for each player
# roll a dice at the start of the turn, move the number of spaces on the dice
# roll 6 means another go (only if you have valid move)
# land on top of opponent means the other piece goes back to yard (start)
# roll 6 to exit yard (start), this moves one square (then roll again because it's a 6)
# if you can't make a move (eg not a 6 at the start) it goes to the next player
# Once a piece passes the finish line it is home and can't move again (it doesn't an need exact roll)
# First player to have all 4 pieces home is winner
