# initialise board + pieces + players (randomly assign player starting point and order)

# for each player 1-4:

# roll dice
# if a valid move is not possible for the current player, break and move to the next player
# else, ask for a response from player (which piece to move that number of spaces)
# check if the response is valid:
#   if valid make the move
#   if not valid ask for another response (you can try 4 times - once each piece - if 4 inputs are invalid, you forfeit)
# after the valid move, check if game is ended
# if game is not ended, check if roll was a six -
#    if yes same player goes again
#    if no, next player

# maybe write a log system per turn / per match - or some game logging statistics summary numbers
